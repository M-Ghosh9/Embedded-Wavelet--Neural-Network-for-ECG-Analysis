# ‚ù§Ô∏è Embedded Wavelet‚ÄìNeural Network for ECG Analysis

This project presents a hybrid approach that combines **wavelet-based signal processing**, **artificial neural networks (ANNs)**, and **embedded IoT deployment** to analyze ECG signals in real time. The goal is to enable accurate heartbeat classification and anomaly detection using lightweight models that can run on microcontrollers like the **ESP8266**, with cloud integration for remote monitoring.

## üß† What is ECG Analysis?

**Electrocardiogram (ECG)** analysis involves interpreting the electrical activity of the heart to detect abnormalities such as arrhythmias, tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation. ECG signals are time-series waveforms that reflect the heart's rhythm and electrical conduction.

Key components of an ECG waveform:
- **P wave**: Atrial depolarization
- **QRS complex**: Ventricular depolarization
- **T wave**: Ventricular repolarization

Accurate ECG analysis is critical for early diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. This project enhances traditional analysis by combining **wavelet transforms** (for denoising and feature extraction) with **neural networks** (for classification).
